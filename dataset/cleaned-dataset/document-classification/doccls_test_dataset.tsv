13086	animal in-vivo	1557	Protective effects of methanolic extract of Juglans regia L. leaf on streptozotocin-induced diabetic peripheral neuropathy in rats.	['Oxidative stress has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), the most common and debilitating complications of diabetes mellitus.', 'There is accumulating evidence that Juglans regia L. (GRL) leaf extract, a rich source of phenolic components, has hypoglycemic and antioxidative properties.', 'This study aimed to determine the protective effects of Juglans regia L. leaf extract against streptozotocin-induced diabetic neuropathy in rat.The DPN rat model was generated by intraperitoneal injection of a single 55 mg/kg dose of streptozotocin (STZ).', 'A subset of the STZ-induced diabetic rats intragastically administered with GRL leaf extract (200 mg/kg/day) before or after the onset of neuropathy, whereas other diabetic rats received only isotonic saline as the same volume of GRL leaf extract.', 'To evaluate the effects of GRL leaf extract on the diabetic neuropathy various parameters, including histopathology and immunohistochemistry of apoptotic and inflammatory factors were assessed along with nociceptive and biochemical assessments.Degeneration of the sciatic nerves which was detected in the STZ-diabetic rats attenuated after GRL leaf extract administration.', 'Greater caspase-3, COX-2, and iNOS expression could be detected in the STZ-diabetic rats, which were significantly attenuated after GRL leaf extract administration.', 'Also, attenuation of lipid peroxidation and nociceptive response along with improved antioxidant status in the sciatic nerve of diabetic rats were detected after GRL leaf extract administration.', 'In other word, GRL leaf extract ameliorated the behavioral and structural indices of diabetic neuropathy even after the onset of neuropathy, in addition to blood sugar reduction.Our results suggest that GRL leaf extract exert preventive and curative effects against STZ-induced diabetic neuropathy in rats which might be due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties.', 'Protection against neuropathy.']

['Dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (DHCA), a lignan compound isolated from Cucurbita moschata, has previously been shown to contain anti-adipogenic and antilipogenic effects on 3T3-L1 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts.', 'As some of phytochemicals derived from natural plants show anti-inflammatory or antioxidative activities, we determined whether DHCA affects the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and also investigated its underlying mechanisms.Raw264.7, a murine macrophage cell line, and primary murine macrophages derived from bone marrow cells were treated with LPS in the presence of DHCA.', 'Furthermore, cells were treated with LPS and palmitate in the presence of DHCA to examine its effect on inflammasomes.', 'The production of various pro-inflammatory mediators was examined and the underlying mechanisms investigated using a variety of molecular biological techniques.', 'To test whether DHCA exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in vivo, mouse dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model was used.DHCA reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta and CCL2) and mediators (iNOS, COX-2 and ROS) by down-regulating the activity of I-kappaB kinase and, subsequently, the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB.', 'Moreover, DHCA effectively suppressed the palmitate-mediated activation of inflammasomes, which resulted in decreased production of IL-1beta.', 'DHCA also showed therapeutic effects in the mouse DSS-induced colitis model by suppressing the production of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and thus preventing weight loss and colon shrinkage.Our data suggest that DHCA is a novel phytochemical that by regulating key molecules involved in inflammation and oxidative stress might exert a broad range of anti-inflammatory activities.']
