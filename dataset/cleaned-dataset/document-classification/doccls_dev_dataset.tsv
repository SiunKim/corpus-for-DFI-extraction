['Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease with poor prognosis and high mortality rate.', 'Panax Notoginseng Saponins (PNS), extracted from Panax Notoginseng as a traditional Asian medicine, displayed a significant anti-fibrosis effect in liver and lung.', 'However, whether Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1), an important and active ingredient of PNS, exerts anti-fibrotic activity on IPF still remain unclear.', 'In this study, we investigated the effect of Rg1 on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats.', 'Bleomycin (5 mg/kg body weight) was intratracheally administrated to male rats.', 'Rg1 (18, 36 and 72 mg/kg) was orally administered on the next day after bleomycin.', 'Lungs were harvested at day 7 and 28 for the further experiments.', 'Histological analysis revealed that bleomycin successfully induced pulmonary fibrosis, and that Rg1 restored the histological alteration of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis (PF), significantly decreased lung coefficient, scores of alveolitis, scores of PF as well as contents of alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) in a dose-dependent manner in PF rats.', 'Moreover, Rg1 increased the expression levels of Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) mRNA and protein, lowered the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) mRNA and protein in the lung tissues of PF rats.', 'These data suggest that Rg1 exhibits protective effect against bleomycin-induced PF in rats, which is potentially associated with the down-regulation of TGF-beta1 and up-regulation of Ca']
1771	animal in-vivo	210	Testosterone and DHEA activate the glucose metabolism-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscle.	['Circulating dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is converted to testosterone or estrogen in the target tissues.', 'Recently, we demonstrated that skeletal muscles are capable of locally synthesizing circulating DHEA to testosterone and estrogen.', 'Furthermore, testosterone is converted to 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5alpha-reductase and exerts biophysiological actions through binding to androgen receptors.', 'However, it remains unclear whether skeletal muscle can synthesize DHT from testosterone and/or DHEA and whether these hormones affect glucose metabolism-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscles.', 'We hypothesized that locally synthesized DHT from testosterone and/or DHEA activates glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4)-regulating pathway in skeletal muscles.', 'The aim of the present study was to clarify whether DHT is synthesized from testosterone and/or DHEA in cultured skeletal muscle cells and whether these hormones affect the GLUT-4-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscles.', 'In the present study, the expression of 5alpha-reductase mRNA was detected in rat cultured skeletal muscle cells, and the addition of testosterone or DHEA increased intramuscular DHT concentrations.', 'Addition of testosterone or DHEA increased GLUT-4 protein expression and its translocation.', 'Furthermore, Akt and protein kinase C-zeta/lambda (PKC-zeta/lambda) phosphorylations, which are critical in GLUT-4-regulated signaling pathways, were enhanced by testosterone or DHEA addition.', 'Testosterone- and DHEA-induced increases in both GLUT-4 expression and Akt and PKC-zeta/lambda phosphorylations were blocked by a DHT inhibitor.', 'Finally, the activities of phosphofructokinase and hexokinase, main glycolytic enzymes, were enhanced by testosterone or DHEA addition.', 'These findings suggest that skeletal muscle is capable of synthesizing DHT from testosterone, and that DHT activates the glucose metabolism-related signaling pathway in skeletal muscle ce']
14695	Observational in human	1752	Risk of osteoporotic fracture in elderly patients taking warfarin: results from the National Registry of Atrial Fibrillation 2.	['BACKGROUND: Vitamin K allows for gamma-carboxylation of glutamyl residues, a conversion that activates clotting factors and bone proteins.', 'Vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin inhibit this process.', 'Our goal was to quantify the association between warfarin and osteoporotic fractures in patients with atrial fibrillation.', 'METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries with atrial fibrillation who were hospitalized between March 1998 and April 1999 in all 50 US states.', 'The study outcome was osteoporotic fractures, identified by an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for a fracture of the hip, spine, or wrist.', 'RESULTS: Compared with 7587 patients who were not prescribed warfarin, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of fracture was 1.25 (95% confidence interval CI, 1.06-1.48) in 4461 patients prescribed long-term warfarin therapy (> or = 1 year).', 'The association between osteoporotic fracture and long-term warfarin use was significant in men (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.26-2.10) but nonsignificant in women (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.88-1.26).', 'In 1833 patients prescribed warfarin for less than a year, the risk of osteoporotic fracture was not increased significantly (OR, 1.03).', 'Odds ratios (95% CIs) of independent predictors of osteoporotic fractures were as follows: increasing age, 1.63 (1.47-1.80) per decade; high fall risk, 1.78 (1.42-2.21); hyperthyroidism, 1.77 (1.16-2.70); neuropsychiatric disease, 1.51 (1.28-1.78); and alcoholism, 1.50 (1.01-2.24).', 'Factors with a reduced OR (95% CI) included African American race, 0.30 (0.18-0.51); male sex, 0.54 (0.46-0.62); and use of beta-adrenergic antagonists, 0.84 (0.70-1.00).', 'CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use of warfarin was associated with osteoporotic fractures, at least in men with atrial fibrillation.', 'Beta-adrenergic antagonists may protect against osteoporotic fractures.']
