8798	animal in-vivo	1037	Antioxidative and antihypertensive effects of Welsh onion on rats fed with a high-fat high-sucrose diet.	['The effects of Welsh onion on the development of hypertension and autoxidation were studied in 6-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats.', 'The rats were fed with a control diet or a high-fat high-sucrose (HFS) diet with or without 5% Welsh onion (green-leafy type or white-sheath type) for 4 weeks.', 'The systolic blood pressure was elevated and the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma were increased in the rats fed with the HFS diet without Welsh onion.', 'The rats fed with the HFS diet containing Welsh onion, especially the green-leafy type, had lower blood pressure.', 'They also had a higher level of nitric oxide (NO) metabolites in both the urine and plasma, lower activity of NADH/NADPH oxidase in the aorta, and suppressed angiotensin II production.', 'The effect of white Welsh onion on decreasing the blood pressure was not significant, although the effects on increasing NO metabolites in the urine and decreasing NADH oxidase activity in the aorta were significant.', 'The TBARS value in the plasma was lowered in the rats fed with either green or white Welsh onion, but the in vitro radical scavenging and ferric reducing antioxidative activities were much higher with green Welsh onion than with the white type.', 'These results suggest that the green-leafy Welsh onion, but not the white type, reduced superoxide generation by suppressing the angiotensine II production and then the NADH/NADPH oxidase activity, increasing the NO availability in the aorta, and consequently lowering the blood pressure in the rats fed with the HFS diet.', 'The radical scavenging and reducing antioxidative activities of green Welsh onion may also be effective in decreasing superox']
3252	animal in-vivo	386	The Ginkgo biloba extract EGb 761(R) and its main constituent flavonoids and ginkgolides increase extracellular dopamine levels in the rat prefrontal cortex.	['BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Experimental and clinical data suggest that extracts of Ginkgo biloba improve cognitive function.', 'However, the neurochemical correlates of these effects are not yet fully clarified.', 'The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute and repeated oral administration of the standardized extract EGb 761((R)) on extracellular levels of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin (5-HT), and the dopamine metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum of conscious rats.', 'EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Monoamines and their metabolites were monitored by the use of microdialysis sampling and HPLC with electrochemical or fluorescence detection.', 'KEY RESULTS: A single oral dose of EGb 761 (100 mg.kg(-1)) had no effect on monoamine levels.', 'However, following chronic (100 mg.kg(-1)/14 days/once daily) treatment, the same dose significantly increased extracellular dopamine and noradrenaline levels, while 5-HT levels were unaffected.', 'Chronic treatment with EGb 761 showed dose-dependent increases in frontocortical dopamine levels and, to a lesser extent, in the striatum.', 'The extracellular levels of HVA and DOPAC were not affected by either acute or repeated doses.', 'Treatment with the main constituents of EGb 761 revealed that the increase in dopamine levels was mostly caused by the flavonol glycosides and ginkgolide fractions, whereas bilobalide treatment was without effect.', 'CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The present results demonstrate that chronic but not acute treatment with EGb 761 increased dopaminergic transmission in the PFC.', 'This finding may be one of the mechanisms underlying the reported effects of G. biloba in improving cognitive function.']
