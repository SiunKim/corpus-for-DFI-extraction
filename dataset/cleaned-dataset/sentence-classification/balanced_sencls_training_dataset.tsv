KEY RESULTS: Compared with controls, testes from doxorubicin-treated rats displayed impaired spermatogenesis, depleted haploid germ cell subpopulations, increased lipid peroxidation products (malondialdehyde), depressed antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione), reduced antioxidant enzyme expression (superoxide dismutase) and elevated apoptotic indexes (pro-apoptotic modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins, intensification of p53 and Apaf-1, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3 and increase of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick-end labelling/sub-haploid cells), while EGb pretreatment effectively alleviated all of these doxorubicin-induced abnormalities in testes.	none_sent
